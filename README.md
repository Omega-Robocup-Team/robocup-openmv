# Robocup OpenMV

The repository written in micropython for the [OpenMV H7 Plus Camera](https://openmv.io/products/openmv-cam-h7-plus). This code performs the detection of a ball and goals on a football field. Later this data is transmitted via SPI to [Teensy 4.1](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html) (main microcontroller on our robocup robot).
